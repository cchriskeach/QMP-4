# QMP-4

This is a fork of QMP-4 built to provide MacOS support.  Support for certain windows-only features has been removed, but it aims to maintain the core quadstick functionality and make it a great choice for mac users.

All credit and love goes to Fred Davidson for building an incredible accessibility product that has brought much joy into the world. Hopefully this fork brings a little more!

## Quick Install

1. Download **[QuadStick.dmg](https://github.com/cchriskeach/QMP-4/releases/download/1.0/QuadStick.dmg)**
2. Open the downloaded DMG file
3. Drag **QuadStick** to your Applications folder
4. Launch QuadStick from Applications!

> **Note:** Make sure your QuadStick is connected to your Mac and does not have "Enable boot in PS4 USB Mode", "Enable virtual XBox controller emulation", or "Enable virtual Dualshock emulation" enabled in the Misc tab.

## Building

Create a python3.10 virtual environment and install requirements.txt.

```sh
conda create -n qmp4 python=3.10
conda activate qmp4
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run it for development, simply execute.

```sh
python3 QuadStick.py
```

To build the app file, do the following:

Active your environment

```sh

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


pyinstaller QuadStick\ Manager\ Program/QuadStick_Mac.spec 
```

You'll find the .app file in <br>

``` QMP-4/QuadStick Manager Program/dist/QuadStick.app ```

## Maintenance

Neither Chris Keach nor Neuralink corporation intend to keep this up to date with the upstream (which has not been updated itself in a reasonable amount of time). If any contributor would like to add additional features, please make an MR!
